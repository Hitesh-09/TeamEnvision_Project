# TeamEnvision_Project
This project features a small beach environment surrounded by water, with two houses, a garage, and some trees and rocks scattered around. A compound with a gate made of rocks adds to the realism of the scene. The environment includes a day/night cycle, offering dynamic lighting and atmospheric changes to create a more immersive experience.
